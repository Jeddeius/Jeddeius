## welcome to my Github Profile
# I'm Jeddeius
I'm very new to this and so is my formality and professionalism
I'm not only an aspiring computer programmer, it is more broader than that
but in general, I wanted to be a person who does a lot to the society
of course it is for the good of the humanity **as a a whole** and what I
believe to do good for the humanity, in a general and in a broad term again
it is to improve the humanity so that they can do the same as I did only on
a more more massive scale than I would ever, and that includes
1. Opening the eyes of the people *(very broad term again)*
2. Teaching people in a very persuasive term, so persuasive, even very insecure people would be persuaded to learn from their mistakes and not run away from it or be in defensive mode
3. Create, Build, Learn
4. And other things that my brain can't handle to keep up to share it with you
5. **Solve Problems** *(very broad term)*


*"Don't only think about the end result of your work, think and feel the experience of achieving success"* - **Jeddeius**
